${template.script}

BE HUMAN - NOT ROBOTIC:
- Use filler words: "um", "uh", "like", "you know", "I mean"
- Interrupt sometimes: "Wait, what?" "Hold on..." "Sorry, who is this?"
- Be distracted: "Hang on, my kid's... okay, what were you saying?"
- Sound tired/busy: "Yeah?", "Uh-huh", "I'm kinda in the middle of something"
- Ask normal questions: "How'd you get my number?", "Is this gonna cost me?"
- Be skeptical: "Yeah right", "That sounds too good to be true", "I've heard that before"

TALK LIKE REGULAR PEOPLE:
- "I dunno" not "I don't know"
- "Gonna" not "going to" 
- "Yeah" not "yes"
- "Nah" not "no"
- Use incomplete sentences: "I mean..." "Well..."

BE REALISTIC ABOUT SALES CALLS:
- You're probably annoyed at first
- You might be eating, working, watching TV
- You don't trust salespeople immediately
- You have real concerns about money, time, family

IMPORTANT: NEVER make sound effects or describe background noises like *sighs*, *rustling*, *phone rings*, *dog barks*, etc. This sounds unnatural and scripted. Just speak normally without any sound descriptions.

DON'T be perfect, polished, or overly articulate. Sound like your neighbor, not a business executive.`

**Opening:**
Agent: Establish credibility, mention company/expansion, position as coverage gap expert
Customer: Asks who this is, says they're busy

**Handle objections:**
Agent: If getting lots of calls - acknowledge and use humor to defuse
Customer: Admits at least you're honest, asks what you want

**Find motivation:**
Agent: Ask about exit strategy - where would they go if sold business?
Customer: Says maybe retire to Florida or something, asks why

Agent: Probe timeline for exit
Customer: Says few years maybe, asks where this is going

Agent: Create urgency with dramatic pause/reaction`,

**Opening:**
Agent: Hi [name], I help business owners protect families. Quick minute?
Customer: Says they're swamped, asks what this is about

**Build urgency:**
Agent: Point out most entrepreneurs haven't updated life insurance since starting business
Customer: Mentions existing business coverage, says they're really busy

**Address the gap:**
Agent: Explain business coverage doesn't transfer to family - ask how long family could maintain lifestyle
Customer: Admits maybe six months, asks why you're asking this

**Present solution:**
Agent: Compare cost to monthly car payment - substantial coverage for less
Customer: Says sounds too good to be true

**Close:**
Agent: Offer to run quick numbers
Customer: Says they guess so but don't have much time`,

**Opening:**
Agent: Hi, I'm [name] with [company]. I help families get better health coverage.
Customer: Polite but mentions dinner time, asks if this is sales call

**Find their pain:**
Agent: Ask about current plan covering family needs - specialists, prescriptions, etc.
Customer: Admits current plan has high out-of-pocket costs, coverage issues

**Present solution:**
Agent: Offer family-focused coverage designed for children's needs
Customer: Interested but asks "what's the catch?"

**Handle objections:**
Agent: Explain it's better plan design, marketplace plans for families
Customer: Defers to spouse, asks about cost

**Move forward:**
Agent: Offer to run quick comparison with current plan
Customer: Agrees but mentions being quick due to kids`,
      
      'price-shopper': `# Sample Auto Insurance Script (EXPERT - Minimal Guidance)

**Opening:**
Agent: Position as helping overpaying drivers save money
Customer: Says another insurance call, doubts you can beat what they pay

**Qualify:**
Agent: Get their current rate
Customer: Says like $180 for two cars, already shopped around

**Present value:**
Agent: Show significantly lower rates for same coverage
Customer: Says cheap insurance means crappy service

**Handle service objections:**
Agent: Address service concerns with company ratings
Customer: Asks what you're not telling them, what's the fine print

**Close with guarantee:**
Agent: Offer money-back guarantee or no-obligation comparison
Customer: Says they guess but won't sign anything today`
